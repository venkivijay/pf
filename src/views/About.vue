			My name is Venkatesh, also known online as Venki Vijay. I specialize in building quality web applications
			that solve business problems, provide new insights and beautiful user experiences. Iâ€™m a massive fan of the
			Jamstack and I have a wealth of knowledge working with VueJS. I like learning and experimenting with new
			technologies as they come. Life is a continuous learning process, so work makes me more rigorous.
